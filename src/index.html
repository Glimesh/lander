        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
        <h3>What's Codename: Recode?</h3>
        <p>Recode is the placeholder name of a live streaming platform focused on discoverability &
            community. Our mission is to build a platform where everyone can have the chance to flourish.</p>

        <h3>Why make this project?</h3>
        <p>The core inspiration of this project has been equality. There are two main problems with existing streaming
            websites: they take too much of a cut and the gap between streamers is great. Recode is our chance to make
            this right, and build a platform that puts the streamers & community first, not the advertisers.</p>

        <h3>What makes Codename: Recode unique?</h3>
        <p>Recode is built by the community, for the community. We are an <a href="https://www.opencompany.org/"
                                                                             target="_blank">Open Company</a>
            dedicated to putting true transparency and openness first. Come see for yourself by joining our Discord!</p>

        <h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
        <p>Let's be realistic, there's a lot to tackle. Design, development, infrastructure and business are all
            key areas we need to build out. However the idea is to tackle it in an MVP approach to get value to
            you as soon as possible and then iterate.</p>

        <h3>How can I help?</h3>
        <p>Easy! Join us in Discord and look for the #volunteers channel and let us know what you can do.</p>
